<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A prize bond can be of any of
	the following denominations:<BR>Rs. 100, Rs. 200, Rs. 750, Rs.
	1,500, Rs. 7,500, Rs. 15,000, Rs. 25,000, Rs. 40,000 – Premium</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Every valid prize bond has to
	have a number, a prefix and an issue date:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Prefix</B>: It is up to 2
		characters long and is always an alphabet</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Number</B>: It is always 6
		characters long and contains only digits from 0 ~ 9</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Issue</B> <B>date</B>: It
		is contained in the stamp that is affixed on the prize bond when it
		is issued by the SBP. A prize bond without such a stamp is not
		considered valid.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet assigns 3 more
		fields to a prize bond which are as follows:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Creation date</B>: Not
			visible to the user. It is the date (and time) when a prize bond
			is saved by the user in Bond Wallet</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Purchase date</B>: It is
			the date when the user purchased the prize bond</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Collection</B>: A prize
			bond can be saved in Bond Wallet only with reference to a
			Collection. A collection is a virtual grouping which may contain
			any number of prize bonds of different denominations. It is up to
			the user to think of a good use of this field.

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in">
<B>RULES:</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prefix and Issue date are not
	mandatory fields. However, if any one of these is entered by the
	user, the other one is required too. It is the app’s way of saying
	that either the user enters complete details or not.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Issue date and purchase dates
	can’t be future dates.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Issue date would always be
	earlier than or same as purchase date, for obvious reasons.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Purchase date is not mandatory
	to be entered by the user but the app always records current date as
	purchase date. User can change it at the time of saving the bond or
	even afterwards but she is not allowed to delete it.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">There can’t be two
	collections of the same name.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Duplication</B>: 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">There can be numerous prize
		bonds with the same number in the market but each such prize bond
		would have a different prefix and issue date.<BR><FONT COLOR="#00b050"><I>Probably,
		now you can guess why Bond Wallet allows either none of the prefix
		and issue date or both</I></FONT><I>.</I></P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A bond is considered duplicate
		when the combination of prefix, bond number and issue date are the
		same. Saving duplicate bonds is not allowed by Bond Wallet. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Duplication is checked across
		all collections. In other words, a bond having same
		prefix-number-issue date can’t be saved in Bond Wallet even if
		the collection name is different.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Draw results, when published
		by the SBP, contain bond numbers only, not the prefix or issue
		date.<BR>So, what happens to the bonds with same number if that
		number is in the draw results? Each instance of such prize bond is
		entitled to claim the prize. For example, if there are 20 prize
		bonds in the market with the same number 122011 (with different
		prefix and issue date, of course) and this number gets a second
		prize in a draw, all 20 will be entitled to claim the prize.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">This point is not about
		duplication but it somehow is relevant to be mentioned here. A bond
		with the same prefix-number-issue date combo can win a prize more
		than once in its lifetime. It is only possible if at the time of
		claiming of prize, the prize bond is not retained by SBP.<BR>As per
		my current information, this practice has now been discontinued by
		SBP for every denomination. However, old prize bonds are still in
		market that have won a prize in the past and were not retained by
		SBP at the time of claiming of prize. Such prize bonds are still
		entitled to win prizes.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet fully caters to
		all the above-mentioned scenarios so that if in future, SBP again
		starts reissuing the same prize bond after payment of prize, the
		app logic is not required to be modified.

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.11in">
<B>FEATURES:</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">At the time of saving a bond,
	denominations are made available in the form of a list. User can
	pick and choose.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Collections, if any, are
	available in the form of a list. However, user can simply type in a
	new collection and it will be automatically created at the time of
	saving the prize bond. User doesn’t need to create a new
	collection on another screen first and then come back to complete
	the <B>Add prize bond</B> form.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Issue date and purchase date
	can be picked from a date picker widget only. User is not allowed to
	‘type’ a date. This provides ease and data security at the same
	time.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Save button is intelligent
	enough to enable or disable itself as the user enters data. It is
	enabled only when all the data is valid; otherwise it would be
	disabled and some error message would be appearing requiring user to
	make the correction.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prize bond series are
	automatically generated for the user. She has to just provide the
	first and the last number of the series. However, series containing
	more than 100 prize bonds are not allowed.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prize bond series can be
	manually edited before saving. User can benefit from this feature
	for dropping those bond numbers that he doesn’t possess in a
	series.<BR>For example, if the user has an incomplete bond series
	where she has, let’s say, 82 bonds out of 100. So, instead of
	punching those 82 bonds one by one, she can provide first and last
	number of 100-bond series and then manually edit it to drop those 18
	bonds that she doesn’t possess, thereby saving a lot of precious
	time.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet provides <B>real
	time validation of prize bond data</B> when the user attempts to
	save a new prize bond or a series thereof. <FONT COLOR="#00b050"><I><B>No
	other prize bond app on Play Store is offering such a feature.</B></I></FONT></P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prize bond or series is
		checked against all draw results available in the app and all
		existing prize bonds saved in the app, on real-time-basis (as the
		user punches data) and findings are shown in an info window which
		is placed right beneath the bond number widget.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">If the entered prize bond is
		found in another collection, it is reported as a duplicate bond and
		user is not allowed to save it.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">If the entered prize bond
		series has let’s say, 5 such duplicate bonds, it would be
		reported as such in the info window; however, that doesn’t block
		the user from saving the series. It is just that those 5 bonds
		won’t be re-saved.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">If the entered bond has won a
		prize in any of the past draws offered by Bond Wallet, this fact
		would be reported. By default, such a prize would be ignored unless
		the user explicitly accepts the prize.<BR>So, if a user is entering
		a bond which has actually won a prize, she would just save the bond
		and accept the prize both at the time of saving the prize bond
		instead of two different entries.<BR>Another benefit is that the
		user gets to know of any such winning that she erroneously
		overlooked before the use of this app.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">It took me almost a month in
		total to perfect it and the best thing is that it takes less than 2
		seconds to perform all the above validations on even slower
		devices. On faster one, it takes less than a sec.</P>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">PRIZES</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Different denominations offer
	different number of prizes with different amounts but there are
	always 3 categories: First prize, Second prize &amp; Third prize.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A bond can win if it qualifies
	on the following:</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<OL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">The bond number appears in a
		relevant draw</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">The issue date of that bond is
		60 days prior to the draw date</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">The draw in which it appears
		is not older than 6 years.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">There are other conditions
		like the physical condition of the bond and whether it is fake or
		not but these are beyond the scope of Bond Wallet</P>
	</OL>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet takes care of all
	the above conditions (1-3) and performs checking in following two
	ways:</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Automatic checking:</B></P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A prize bond or series is/are
			checked automatically against all valid available draws (valid =
			not older than 6 years) right at the time such prize bond or
			series are saved.</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Winners are declared after
			taking into consideration the issue date of the prize bond such
			that prize bonds have issue date not older than 60 days from the
			draw date are not declared as winners.</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">If any of the prize bonds
			have won prize, such fact is shown in the Info widget right inside
			the Add Prize bond screen.</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Declared prizes are ignored
			by default but offers an edit button to either <B>Accept / Ignore</B>
			the prizes listed therein.</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prizes are ignored by default
			due to the fact that if a user is entering prize bonds in Bond
			Wallet for the first time, there is more chances that they have
			claimed prizes against these bonds already. 
			</P>
		</UL>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Secondly, since
same numbers can appear in multiple draws, user’s newly purchased
bonds can appear as winners especially when the user doesn’t
mention prefix and issue date. So, in most of the cases, user would
just review the prizes and let them be ignored.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in">However, to
cover the rather less probable case where the bond actually won a
prize, there is that option to <B>Accept</B> the prize. For that, the
user would open the edit screen and tap on the prize icon to Accept
it as a winning prize bond. 
</P>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<UL>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A prize once ignored would
			never be reported as a prize whenever the user checks such bond
			even against old draws. This is done to save the user of the pain
			of ignoring the same prizes again and again.</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Home page offers a Prize
			button/card that shows the list of prizes (collection and
			denomination wise). Such prize list shows prizes divided into two
			main categories (tabs), i.e., Accepted and Ignored and you already
			know from above description what sort of prizes these two
			categories host.</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Ignored prizes</B> are
			shown as dimmed in order to make them even appear as ignored.
			<U>However, users have the option to re-accept any of these, if
			they later find out that ignoring the prize was a mistake on their
			part.</U> Re-accepting would shift such an ignored prize to the
			Accepted tab/category.</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Accepted prizes</B> are
			actually <B>unclaimed prizes</B> and they stay as unclaimed and
			reported as such until these are marked as claimed by the user.
			Collections page shows the number of unclaimed prizes in red in
			each denomination block that blinks for some time, each time the
			user opens that page, so that the user remembers there is
			something pending to be done on his part. <U>An accepted prize can
			later be ignored if the user finds out that accepting the prize
			was a mistake on her part.</U> Ignoring at this stage will shift
			this prize from Accepted to Ignored tab.<BR><FONT COLOR="#00b050">Treatment/presentation
			of unclaimed bonds can still be improved and therefore, I would
			like some suggestions from a user’s perspective.</FONT></P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">When the user attempts to
			mark an accepted prize as claimed, he is prompted with a question
			about whether this prize bond was surrendered to SBP at the time
			of claim of prize or not. As per my discussion with a banker, now
			all prize bonds are surrendered but I would still like to have a
			definitive word on it. Till then, this prompt stays.<BR>Treatment
			in both cases is as follows and there is <B>room for discussion</B>
			too:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Not-surrendered: Such prize

			<UL>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Any saved prize bond can be
				checked against a single, multiple of all draws. However,
				normally there won’t be any reported prizes because all prizes
				would have been reported at the time of saving the bonds and
				either ignored or accepted right at that time.<BR>However, now
				after the suggestion of Babar sb, I may implement this screen
				such that earlier Accepted (Both unclaimed and claimed) prizes
				also appear here.</P>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">The best part of Bond Wallet
				is that it offers to check all prize bonds of a denomination
				saved in a collection be checked against any number of valid
				draws without the hassle of picking them one by one and get the
				prizes, if any. This is a paid feature and paid users are
				expected to utilize this as soon as a draw is released. However,
				as the heading suggests, this is a manual procedure and while the
				users will receive the notification about a new draw and while it
				will be downloaded automatically, the user would still have to
				perform checking her prize bonds against that draws manually.</P>

		user didn’t bother to enter the issue date at the time of saving
		the prize and now all past prizes against the same number (without
		consideration of prefix/issue date) are popping up. These need to

		prizes.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Accepted / Unclaimed</B>:
		These are the type of prizes that user’s prize bond has actually
		earned. If user provided a prefix and issue date at the time of
		saving the prize bond, then Bond wallet is 100% sure about the
		winning eligibility of that prize bonds; if issue date was not
		provided, then we would have to rely on the user’s feedback.

	cache. However, they say that it restores the status within 24
	hours. Since test subscription don’t last for this long, I’ve
	been unable to test this.<BR>Another issue is that I use Bond wallet
	on my test device from both Google Play and Debug channel…while in
	theory, it shouldn’t cause any issue, I’ve a wild guess it
	actually does.<BR><FONT COLOR="#00b050"><B>So I would request for a

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A free user can save up to
	1,500 prize bonds and 15 prizes in up to 2 collections. A paid

	has access to all draw results just like a paid subscriber but a
	free user can look up a single bond while paid subscriber can look
	up all bonds of a denomination at the same time.<BR>For example, a
	paid subscriber has 1,000 bonds of Rs. 200 in a collection and a new
	draw is released. She can just select that draw and all the 2,000
	bonds of the that collection would be looked up in that draw in kind
	of a single click and winning bonds reported to the user in a jiffy.
	Free user is allowed access to draw results but she will have to
	look up one bond at a time, thereby making this feature valuable and
	tempting enough to go for a paid subscription.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">All types of users can <B>back

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Avoidance of abuse</B>:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Consider a scenario where a
		user purchases paid subscription of let’s say, one month. In that
		month, she punches let’s say 5,000 prize bonds of different
		denominations in let’s say 5 different collections. Further she
		cancels the subscription before the completion of one month. Such a
		user has overcome the usage restriction of 1,500 bonds and 2
		collections but still she isn’t allowed to use the premium
		feature of bulk lookup mentioned at 3 above. Whenever a new draw is
		released, she would have to go through each of the many bonds of
		that denomination one by one in order to see if any of these won a
		prize or not. This keeps the paid subscription still tempting for
		her.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Taking above scenario a step
		further, if she purchases more bonds, she can still manipulate her
		storage of 5,000 bonds by editing prize bond data and punching data
		of new bonds instead if the upcoming draw is of newly purchased
		bonds. This way she on the one hand can wrongly maintain her 5,000
		usage limit and keep updating it with new bond numbers. In order to
		avoid this, a free user is not allowed to edit bond number if her
		usage limit is already reached. Rest of the field like collection,
		prefix etc. can be edited though.<BR>NOTE: This feature is still to
		be implemented.<BR><BR><BR>
