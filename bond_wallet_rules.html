<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">PRIZE BOND &amp; PRIZE</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A prize bond can be of any of
	the following denominations:<BR>Rs. 100, Rs. 200, Rs. 750, Rs.
	1,500, Rs. 7,500, Rs. 15,000, Rs. 25,000, Rs. 40,000 – Premium</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Every valid prize bond has to
	have a number, a prefix and an issue date:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Prefix</B>: It is up to 2
		characters long and is always an alphabet</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Number</B>: It is always 6
		characters long and contains only digits from 0 ~ 9</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Issue</B> <B>date</B>: It
		is contained in the stamp that is affixed on the prize bond when it
		is issued by the SBP. A prize bond without such a stamp is not
		considered valid.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet assigns 3 more
		fields to a prize bond which are as follows:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Creation date</B>: Not
			visible to the user. It is the date (and time) when a prize bond
			is saved by the user in Bond Wallet</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Purchase date</B>: It is
			the date when the user purchased the prize bond</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Collection</B>: A prize
			bond can be saved in Bond Wallet only with reference to a
			Collection. A collection is a virtual grouping which may contain
			any number of prize bonds of different denominations. It is up to
			the user to think of a good use of this field. 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">User may choose to have just
				one collection and save all their prize bonds in it.</P>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">It may be used to record
				family member name in case different members have different prize
				bonds and they want to record all of them in just one instance of
				Bond Wallet.</P>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">It may be the year grouping

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.11in">
<B>RULES:</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prefix and Issue date are not
	mandatory fields. However, if any one of these is entered by the
	user, the other one is required too. It is the app’s way of saying
	that either the user enters complete details or not.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Issue date and purchase dates
	can’t be future dates.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Issue date would always be
	earlier than or same as purchase date, for obvious reasons.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Purchase date is not mandatory
	to be entered by the user but the app always records current date as
	purchase date. User can change it at the time of saving the bond or
	even afterwards but she is not allowed to delete it.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">There can’t be two
	collections of the same name.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Duplication</B>: 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">There can be numerous prize
		bonds with the same number in the market but each such prize bond
		would have a different prefix and issue date.<BR><FONT COLOR="#00b050"><I>Probably,
		now you can guess why Bond Wallet allows either none of the prefix
		and issue date or both</I></FONT><I>.</I></P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A bond is considered duplicate
		when the combination of prefix, bond number and issue date are the
		same. Saving duplicate bonds is not allowed by Bond Wallet. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Duplication is checked across
		all collections. In other words, a bond having same
		prefix-number-issue date can’t be saved in Bond Wallet even if
		the collection name is different.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Draw results, when published
		by the SBP, contain bond numbers only, not the prefix or issue
		date.<BR>So, what happens to the bonds with same number if that
		number is in the draw results? Each instance of such prize bond is
		entitled to claim the prize. For example, if there are 20 prize
		bonds in the market with the same number 122011 (with different
		prefix and issue date, of course) and this number gets a second
		prize in a draw, all 20 will be entitled to claim the prize.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">This point is not about
		duplication but it somehow is relevant to be mentioned here. A bond
		with the same prefix-number-issue date combo can win a prize more
		than once in its lifetime. It is only possible if at the time of
		claiming of prize, the prize bond is not retained by SBP.<BR>As per
		my current information, this practice has now been discontinued by
		SBP for every denomination. However, old prize bonds are still in
		market that have won a prize in the past and were not retained by
		SBP at the time of claiming of prize. Such prize bonds are still
		entitled to win prizes.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet fully caters to
		all the above-mentioned scenarios so that if in future, SBP again
		starts reissuing the same prize bond after payment of prize, the
		app logic is not required to be modified.

<B>FEATURES:</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">At the time of saving a bond,
	denominations are made available in the form of a list. User can
	pick and choose.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Collections, if any, are
	available in the form of a list. However, user can simply type in a
	new collection and it will be automatically created at the time of
	saving the prize bond. User doesn’t need to create a new
	collection on another screen first and then come back to complete
	the <B>Add prize bond</B> form.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Issue date and purchase date
	can be picked from a date picker widget only. User is not allowed to
	‘type’ a date. This provides ease and data security at the same
	time.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Save button is intelligent
	enough to enable or disable itself as the user enters data. It is
	enabled only when all the data is valid; otherwise it would be
	disabled and some error message would be appearing requiring user to
	make the correction.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prize bond series are
	automatically generated for the user. She has to just provide the
	first and the last number of the series. However, series containing
	more than 100 prize bonds are not allowed.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prize bond series can be
	manually edited before saving. User can benefit from this feature
	for dropping those bond numbers that he doesn’t possess in a
	series.<BR>For example, if the user has an incomplete bond series
	where she has, let’s say, 82 bonds out of 100. So, instead of
	punching those 82 bonds one by one, she can provide first and last
	number of 100-bond series and then manually edit it to drop those 18
	bonds that she doesn’t possess, thereby saving a lot of precious
	time.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet provides <B>real
	time validation of prize bond data</B> when the user attempts to
	save a new prize bond or a series thereof. <FONT COLOR="#00b050"><I><B>No
	other prize bond app on Play Store is offering such a feature.</B></I></FONT></P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Prize bond or series is
		checked against all draw results available in the app and all
		existing prize bonds saved in the app, on real-time-basis (as the
		user punches data) and findings are shown in an info window which
		is placed right beneath the bond number widget.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">If the entered prize bond is
		found in another collection, it is reported as a duplicate bond and
		user is not allowed to save it.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">If the entered prize bond
		series has let’s say, 5 such duplicate bonds, it would be
		reported as such in the info window; however, that doesn’t block
		the user from saving the series. It is just that those 5 bonds
		won’t be re-saved.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">If the entered bond has won a
		prize in any of the past draws offered by Bond Wallet, this fact
		would be reported. By default, such a prize would be ignored unless
		the user explicitly accepts the prize.<BR>So, if a user is entering
		a bond which has actually won a prize, she would just save the bond
		and accept the prize both at the time of saving the prize bond
		instead of two different entries.<BR>Another benefit is that the
		user gets to know of any such winning that she erroneously
		overlooked before the use of this app.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">It took me almost a month in
		total to master it and the best thing is that it takes less than 2
		seconds to perform all the above validations on even slower
		devices. On faster one, it takes less than a sec.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">DRAW RESULTS</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Draw results are pushed to Bond
	wallet online after these are released on SBP website. This is a
	manual process from developer point of view and requires only 5 to
	10 min to format and upload the results. From user’s point of
	view, there is nothing manual about it as explained below.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">This requires a working
	internet connection, for obvious reasons.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Each user gets a notification
	whenever a new draw result is made available.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">User doesn’t need to manually
	download new draw results. Bond wallet receives these and saves
	these in permanent storage automatically.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Once downloaded, all results
	can be accessed offline.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">However, an option is still
	provided where the user can check for updated draws manually. This
	is not really necessary but has been provided just in case.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">BACKUP / RESTORE</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet allows local back

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">User has the option to select
	the location where she wants to save the backup file.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Backup file stays on the device
	even after the app is uninstalled. However, it would be removed if
	the user resets her device. In such cases, user can easily pull the
	file and store it elsewhere before resetting her device</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">When the backed up data is
	restored, it replaces the existing data with the backed up data.
	User is properly warned about this fact before she plans to initiate
	a restoration process.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">USAGE RESTRICTIONS / PREMIUM
FEATURES:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Bond wallet is free to download
	and use but a free user has restricted access to app storage and
	premium features.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">A free user can save up to
	1,500 prize bonds and 15 prizes in up to 2 collections. A paid
	subscriber has unlimited storage access.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Bulk lookup</B>: A free user
	has access to all draw results just like a paid subscriber but a
	free user can look up a single bond while paid subscriber can look
	up all bonds of a denomination at the same time.<BR>For example, a
	paid subscriber has 1,000 bonds of Rs. 200 in a collection and a new
	draw is released. She can just select that draw and all the 2,000
	bonds of the that collection would be looked up in that draw in kind
	of a single click and winning bonds reported to the user in a jiffy.
	Free user is allowed access to draw results but she will have to
	look up one bond at a time, thereby making this feature valuable and
	tempting enough to go for a paid subscription.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">All types of users can <B>back
	up</B> their saved prize bond data but only paid subscribers are
	allowed to <B>restore</B> backed up data.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>Avoidance of abuse</B>:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Consider a scenario where a
		user purchases paid subscription of let’s say, one month. In that
		month, she punches let’s say 5,000 prize bonds of different
		denominations in let’s say 5 different collections. Further she
		cancels the subscription before the completion of one month. Such a
		user has overcome the usage restriction of 1,500 bonds and 2
		collections but still she isn’t allowed to use the premium
		feature of bulk lookup mentioned at 3 above. Whenever a new draw is
		released, she would have to go through each of the many bonds of
		that denomination one by one in order to see if any of these won a
		prize or not. This keeps the paid subscription still tempting for
		her.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><A NAME="_GoBack"></A>Taking
		above scenario a step further, if she purchases more bonds, she can
		still manipulate her storage of 5,000 bonds by editing prize bond
		data and punching data of new bonds instead if the upcoming draw is
		of newly purchased bonds. This way she on the one hand can wrongly
		maintain her 5,000 usage limit and keep updating it with new bond
		numbers. In order to avoid this, a free user is not allowed to edit
		bond number if her usage limit is already reached. Rest of the
		field like collection, prefix etc. can be edited though.<BR>NOTE:
		This feature is still to be implemented.<BR><BR><BR>
