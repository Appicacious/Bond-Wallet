  <h1>Bond Wallet – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 01, 2020<br />
     <strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 31, 2025</p>

  <p>Appicacious ("we", "our", or "us") built the <strong>Bond Wallet</strong> app as an <strong>ad-supported freemium app</strong>. This app is provided by Appicacious at no cost (with optional paid features) and is intended for use as-is.</p>

  <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your data when you use the Bond Wallet app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not require users to create an account</strong> or provide personally identifiable information (PII) directly. However, certain types of data are collected automatically by third-party services we integrate to provide core features, analytics, crash diagnostics, ads, and notifications.</p>

  <p><strong>The following categories of data may be collected automatically:</strong></p>

  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:
    <ul>

      <li>Phone number</li>

    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following third-party services, which may collect and process user data as described above. Each service operates under its own privacy policy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. Use of Cookies and Identifiers</h2>
  <p>Bond Wallet does <strong>not use cookies</strong> directly. However, third-party services integrated into the app (such as Firebase and AppLovin) may use cookie-equivalent technologies like device identifiers and ad IDs to provide services such as analytics and advertising.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>All automatically collected data is retained as per the retention policies of the respective third-party services. We do not store any user data on our own servers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Firebase retains analytics and crash data for varying periods (usually up to 14 months).</li>
    <li>AppLovin retains ad data based on their policy and user consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Deletion Requests</h2>
  <p>Since the app does not use user accounts and does not store personal data directly, we do not have access to delete user data ourselves. However, you may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reset your advertising ID from your device settings.</li>
    <li>Opt out of personalized ads through Google settings.</li>
    <li>Contact us for guidance or to request deletion via third-party services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We use commercially acceptable means of protecting data transmitted via third-party services. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Bond Wallet is <strong>not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised accordingly. Continued use of the app after changes implies acceptance.</p>
