	<p class="block_">Bond Wallet &ndash; Terms &amp; Conditions</p>
	<p class="block_1">Effective from June 01, 2020</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Appicacious (“we”/”us”/”our”) built Bond Wallet (“App”) as an Ad Supported app. This App is provided by Appicacious at no cost (only premium features are required to be paid for) and is intended for use as is.</p>
	<p class="block_4">By downloading or using the App, these terms will automatically apply to the users (“you”/”your”) of the App &ndash; you should make sure therefore, that you read them carefully before using the App. </p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Intellectual Property</p>
	<p class="block_4">You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the App into other languages, or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to Appicacious. </p>
	<p class="block_4">Appicacious is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for. </p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Payments</p>
	<p class="block_4">We don’t accept any direct payments. All the payments made in order to purchase subscription plan(s) are handled by Google Play Store. Please visit Google Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/" class="calibre1"><span class="text_">Terms of Service</span></a> for more information.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Pricing</p>
	<p class="block_4">The App is free to download but offers paid subscription plan(s) to access various premium features. Subscriptions are recurring until the user opts for cancelation. Subscription prices may be changed at our sole discretion and in accordance with the terms of <a href="https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/" class="text_">Google Play Store</a>, in this regard.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Free users</p>
	<p class="block_4">Currently, the App is offered for free use for an unlimited time period. Free users can’t access the premium features, are served with ads and have to follow fair usage limits on a periodical basis. All these time periods and limits, however, are subject to change at our sole discretion.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Paid subscribers</p>
	<p class="block_4">The App offers subscription plan(s) via Google Play In-App Purchases. Paid subscribers are provided access to premium features and content but only during the course of the period in which their paid subscription remains active.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Free trial</p>
	<p class="block_4">Appicacious may, at its sole discretion, offer a paid subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time which is subject to changes without prior notice.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Refunds</p>
	<p class="block_4">Subscription payments are non-refundable.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Cancelation</p>
	<p class="block_4">You may cancel your paid subscription at any time. However, cancelation will take effect on the upcoming renewal date and your current subscription will remain active till that date.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Personal data and User’s Responsibilities</p>
	<p class="block_4">Bond Wallet stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide better functionality and service. It’s your responsibility to keep your device and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your device, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your device vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your device’s security features and it could mean that the App won’t work properly or at all. </p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Third-party - Terms and Conditions</p>
	<p class="block_4">The App does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the App: </p>

	<p class="block_6">App updates &amp; App availability</p>
	<p class="block_4">At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on Android &ndash; the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Appicacious does not promise that it will always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device. </p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Links to Other Websites</p>
	<p class="block_4">Our App may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.</p>
	<p class="block_4">You acknowledge and agree that Appicacious shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such third party web sites or services.</p>
	<p class="block_4">We strongly advise you to read and understand the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any such third-party web sites or services yourself.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Termination</p>
	<p class="block_4">We may terminate or suspend your access to the App and the content provided by it immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>
	<p class="block_4">In addition to that, access to any content supplied by the App and saved locally on user’s device can be terminated at any time by us without prior notice.</p>
	<p class="block_4">If you wish to terminate your access yourself, you may simply discontinue using the App and, if you are a paid subscriber, cancel your paid subscription.</p>
	<p class="block_4">All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Indemnification</p>
	<p class="block_4">You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Appicacious, its owners, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, if any, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the App, by you or any person using your device; b) a breach of these Terms, or c) content provided through the App.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_6">Limitation of Liability</p>
	<p class="block_4">You should be aware that there are certain things that Appicacious will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the App will require the App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Appicacious cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left. </p>
	<p class="block_4">If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App. </p>
	<p class="block_4">Along the same lines, Appicacious cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the App i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged &ndash; if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the services offered by the App, Appicacious cannot accept any responsibility. </p>
	<p class="block_4">With respect to Appicacious’s responsibility for your use of the App, when you’re using the App, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Appicacious accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the App.</p>
	<p class="block_5">&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="block_4">Your use of our App is at your sole risk. The App content is provided on an "as is" basis. The App is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.</p>
	<p class="block_4">Appicacious and its affiliates do not warrant that a) the App will function uninterrupted, be secure or be available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; or c) the results of using the App will meet your requirements.</p>
